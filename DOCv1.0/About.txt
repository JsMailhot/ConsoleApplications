What is DOC?

DOC (Documents on console) is a console application which allows users to view several types of documents in the console itself.

What does DOC do?

When prompted for a document the user is able to give any document and if accepted view that document on the console.
DOC formats files so they fit to the console layout, misformatted files may not appear correctly.

How do I use DOC?

All you have to do is run the .exe file inside the debug folder in order to start the application.
Once the application has started it will prompt you with the startup text, pressing any key will continue to the next screen.
The next screen will prompt you for input of a file path and name, this is the full file path and name of your file you are viewing.
Example of a proper file path and name to input:  C:\example\file\path\exampleFileName.ext (ext is the extension on the file).

How does DOC work?

Documents consumed by DOC are converted into text which is formatted to fit on the display of the console.
Some files are able to be displayed without being altered, however this is not always the case.
Many file types have hard to read formats or simply won't work within the console, in these cases the text is slightly modified so it works.

Why does DOC exist?

DOC was designed with the purpose of allowing users who enjoy the feeling of using a console (like myself) to view files how they like to.
DOC was also designed for a personal portfolio which is purposed to showcase many of the talents capable by it's creator.
